## GSoC'21 Proposal:

Title: Interactive visualization of neurophysiology data in NWB Widgets

Category: other_project

Abstract:
The goal of NWB is to develop a unified, extensible, open-source data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data, one of the most common and important data types in neuroscience. The goal here will be to assist neurophysiologists in using their data to more deeply understand how brains function.We will be using the results of DeepLabCut Algorithms and will be reading the results and providing interactive visualization components that will allow scientists to explore those results across many datasets.

The goal of this specific project are as follows:

1.Interactive visualization, helps researchers to gain scientific insights.

2.Play around with the data to draw various scientific conclusions.

3.Navigate data to visualize specific data elements.
